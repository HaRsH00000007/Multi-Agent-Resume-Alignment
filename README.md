# Multi-Agent-Resume-Alignment
Overview

Multi-Agent Resume Alignment is an innovative project that leverages a multi-agent system to tailor resumes and prepare candidates for job applications. By combining specialized agents—each responsible for research, profiling, resume strategy, and interview preparation—this system intelligently aligns a candidate’s resume with job postings and produces supporting documents such as tailored resumes and interview materials.

Features

> Job Posting Analysis: The Researcher agent scrapes job postings to extract key skills, experiences, and qualifications.

> Personal Profiling: The Profiler agent compiles a comprehensive profile using data from GitHub and personal write-ups.

> Resume Tailoring: The Resume Strategist agent updates and refines the resume by aligning the candidate’s skills and experiences with the job requirements.

> Interview Preparation: The Interview Preparer agent generates targeted interview questions and talking points based on the tailored resume and job description.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture

The project is structured around a set of agents that work in tandem:

> Tech Job Researcher: Extracts and analyzes job posting content.

> Personal Profiler for Engineers: Aggregates information from various sources to build a detailed personal and professional profile.

> Resume Strategist for Engineers: Aligns and enhances the resume by incorporating insights from job requirements and personal profiles.

> Engineering Interview Preparer: Develops interview preparation materials to help candidates showcase their fit for the job.

Each agent is equipped with specific tools such as web scraping, file reading, and semantic search capabilities to perform its role effectively.
